Though labradors are a very friendly breed, they can often be moody. Not to mention the fact that they're pure-bred can lead to numerous issues related to their physiological health. 

Golden retrievers are also make a great choice for a pet. One point to note though is that the males of this breed often display behaviour reminiscent of a certain celebrity which can be curtailed with some singing. 

Indie dogs are not for the faint-hearted but it can be very rewarding having one at home once you get used to their propensity to bite and chew most things within their grasp. 

Some of the songs which work with dogs are those with strange, even bizarre lyrics such as many of the songs composed by David Bowie and Duran Duran. These aged (and in the case of Bowie, dead) icons of Pop composed some fantastic music, but their lyrics leads one to question their state of mind when they came up with them.

The Beatles are another band whose music may fall in the same category. Their tunes are universally adored, but the lyrics of songs such as "I am the Walrus" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" are inscrutable to say the least.
